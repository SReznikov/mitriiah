### To do list:

####Priority


- sorting of ranges in the window

- prevent range duplicates and overlapping ranges
- sorting of atoms for ranges

- general debugging



####Nice to have

- splitting a column in .gro into two separate ones
- menu bar allowing to open multiple rmsf/gro in new tabs
- ability to delete points from graph by clicking on them
- possibly use table view instead of list view
- add rectangle selector for conveniance
- visual representation on the rmsf graph of the ranges selected

####Maybe will get there one day

- calling gromacs as an option to create a full index file
- path selection + save button for outputting the atom list
